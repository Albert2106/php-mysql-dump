#Description:
Dump all accessible databases and tables to HTML format.

I made this script for my needs during my PWK/OSCP training for one box.

Sometimes you can't get an interactive reverse shell (for example because of a Firewall) but
you must access to database to grab additional usernames / passwords.

If you find a way to execute PHP code (ex: LFI/RFI), you can use that script (minified or not) and
get the job done ;)
